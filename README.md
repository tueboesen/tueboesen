Hi! I'm Tue Boesen

My main scientific focus areas are currently: machine learning and protein folding. More specifically, within machine learning I have worked extensively with equivariant, graph-based, transfer-learning, and self-supervised learning. The goal of my work in machine learning have always been fundamentally understand why neural networks work, which I believe is best done by connecting neural networks with well-established areas of mathematics.
