Hi! I'm Tue Boesen.

I'm a data scientist.
My main scientific focus areas are currently: machine learning and molecular dynamics / protein folding. 
I have worked extensively with graph-based neural networks and equivariant neural networks, and my main research area has been connecting well-established fields in mathematics with machine learning. 

My CV can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tueboesen/CV/master/out/cv.pdf).
