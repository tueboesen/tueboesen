Hi! I'm Tue Boesen.

I'm a data scientist.
My main scientific focus areas are currently: machine learning and protein folding. More specifically, within machine learning, I have worked extensively with: equivariant, graph-based, transfer-learning, and self-supervised learning. The goal of my work in machine learning has always been to fundamentally understand why neural networks work, which I believe is best done by connecting them with well-established areas of mathematics.

Building on the experience I have gained through my research I have founded the machine learning consulting company: Neural Solutions.
