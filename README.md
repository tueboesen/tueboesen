Hi! I'm Tue Boesen.

I am a machine learning scientist and have previously worked as: software developer, researcher, project lead, and technical advisor/consultant on various projects.
I have a solid foundation in: physics, mathematics, data science, and high-performance-computing.
I am familiar with programming best practices and generating production-ready code.
Within machine learning, I have specialized in physics-informed and graph neural networks, but I have experience with most areas of deep learning, and I have applied machine learning in many different fields.

My CV can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tueboesen/CV/master/out/cv.pdf).
